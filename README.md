# Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) - Python Implementation  

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA)**, inspired by the original MATLAB code and the research paper:  
*"The Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm"* by Abualigah, L., Diabat, A., Mirjalili, S., Abd Elaziz, M., and Gandomi, A. H.  

AOA is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by basic arithmetic operations. It is designed to solve complex optimization problems efficiently.

## 📖 Algorithm Overview  

The Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) simulates the process of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to achieve exploration and exploitation in the search space.  

### Main Parameters  
- **Population Size:** Number of candidate solutions.  
- **Iterations:** Maximum number of iterations.  
- **Search Boundaries:** The range for the solution space.  
- **Objective Function:** The function to minimize or maximize.  

Refer to the original paper for a detailed description of the algorithm's steps and mathematical formulation.
